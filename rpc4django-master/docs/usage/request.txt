Access to HttpRequest
=====================

RPC4Django allows RPC methods to be written in such a way that they have
access to Django's HttpRequest_ object. This can be used
to see the type of request, the user making the request or any specific
headers in the request object. To use this, methods must be written such 
that they can accept arbitrary
keyword arguments. Although currently only the HttpRequest object is sent,
additional keyword arguments may be sent in the future.

     return str(kwargs.get('request', None))
